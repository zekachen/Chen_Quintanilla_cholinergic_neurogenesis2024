#Apply Matlab2022 or higher version to open the code for analyzing fiber photometry code
#The analysis of fiber photometry includes unmixing the raw data recorded by OceanView, extracting episodes, finding appropriate thresholding, calculating the cumulative activity and drawing plots.
#Apply R to open the code to analyze snRNA-Sequence data.
# Thanks to Dr. Luis Quintanilla, Dr. Todd Farmer, Dr. HeChen Bao, and Dr. Tzu-Hao Harry Chao for helping with the coding.
